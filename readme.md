# Bulla Factoring Pool Contracts V1

## Overview

The Bulla Factoring contracts specifically enable the creation of credit pools for invoice factoring, adhering to the **ERC4626** specification. Through these contracts, invoice issuers can factor their receivables, allowing them to receive early payments in exchange for a premium. This integration not only broadens the utility of the Bulla Claim Protocol but also provides a new financial mechanism for liquidity and credit management on-chain.
